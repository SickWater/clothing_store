HOW WE WILL PROCEED (This order prevents mistakes)
STEP 1 — You send the backend NOW

Send the backend files in this order:

Product.js

multerConfig.js

productRoutes.js

adminRoutes.js

db.js

server.js

I will analyse them and map them to the features you want.

✅ STEP 2 — I tell you what needs to change in the backend

Before we touch the frontend:

I check if the backend can support stock-by-size

If schema supports sale price, thumbnails, categories, etc

If login system is missing → I design clean version

If productRoutes need expansion → fix it

If adminRoutes match admin page → fix it

If multerConfig needs updating for multiple images → fix it

Basically I’ll make sure:

The backend is 100% ready for all features in Phase 1–5.

✅ STEP 3 — Then you send admin HTML + admin JS

With backend matched to admin structure, I will:

Fix adding/editing products

Add filtering

Add size stock editing

Add image preview system

Add admin search

Fix upload structure

Build clean admin UI logic
